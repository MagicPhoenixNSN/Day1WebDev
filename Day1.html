        <h4> By "Stolen from the internet"</h4>
        <p>All fairness, there's no reason why pineapple 
        pizza should work. This prickly, distinctive fruit offers a strong <br> flavor that tends 
        to dominate when used in recipes. Pineapple lends itself well to baking and <br> grilling, though most of these combinations
        do not involve cheese. </p>
